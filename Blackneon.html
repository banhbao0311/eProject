        <p class="gallerypha">These fully aquatic frogs prefer a calm and well-maintained tank with a non-sharp substrate and plenty of hiding spots. Ensure they have access to the water’s surface as they need to breathe air. Avoid keeping African Dwarf Frogs with large or aggressive species that may pose a threat. Pay close attention during feeding time to ensure they get their fair share of food, as they have poor eyesight and eat relatively slowly.</p>

        <p class="gallerypha">These small plecos require driftwood in their tank setup, as they naturally graze on decaying wood in the wild. In addition to wood, provide a variety of hiding spots like plants, rocks, and caves to make them feel secure.
